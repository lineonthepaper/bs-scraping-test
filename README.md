# Web table scraping with BeautifulSoup - a test
## this is me learning to use BeautifulSoup and pandas through scraping PokeDB for available Pokemon on a route!
when user runs code and enters the URL of the PokeDB page to be scraped, it will print a pandas dataframe of the available Pokemon on that route as well as their encounter levels, sorted by encounter method.
