## Web table scraping with BeautifulSoup - a test
**this is me learning to use BeautifulSoup and pandas through scraping PokeDB for available Pokemon on a route!**
<br>
when user runs code and enters the URL of the PokeDB page to be scraped, it will print a pandas dataframe of the available Pokemon on that route as well as their encounter levels, sorted by encounter method. 
<br>
anyway, I made this solely as BS practice! I'm pretty sure PokeDB doesn't like people scraping their data en masse, so I decided not to scale it up from here. please don't take advantage of their generous website :(
